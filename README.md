# TOP-MessageBoard

## Description

An awesome message board that lets non-users view content, but not who it's from. People can register to become users and view all content and post more content. Admins have the ability to delete posts. Both users and messages are saved in the database, so no need to worry about lost data due to restarting the instance.

This is part of The ODIN Project's curriculum.
